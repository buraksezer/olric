  #
  # An Olric node checks operation status before taking any action for the

  # Bootstrapping status is one of the most important checkpoints for an

  # * 1 - Generally useful for this to ALWAYS be visible to an operator

  #   * Logging extra info about a panic
  #   * CLI argument handling
  # * 2 - A reasonable default log level if you don't want verbosity.
  #   * Information about config (listening on X, watching Y)
  #   * Errors that repeat frequently that relate to conditions that can be
  #     corrected
  # * 3 - Useful steady state information about the service and
  #     important log messages that may correlate to
  #   significant changes in the system.  This is the recommended default log
  #     level for most systems.
  #   * Logging HTTP requests and their exit code
  #   * System state changing
  #   * Controller state change events
  #   * Scheduler log messages
  # * 4 - Extended information about changes
  #   * More info about system state changes
  # * 5 - Debug level verbosity
  #   * Logging in particularly thorny parts of code where you may want to come
  #     back later and check it
  # * 6 - Trace level verbosity
  #   * Context to understand the steps leading up to neterrors and warnings
  #   * More information for troubleshooting reported issues
